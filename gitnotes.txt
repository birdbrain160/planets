Git is a version control platform.  It allows you to take snapshots of your work as you go, and then saves them 
in a digital filing cabinet.  In order for git to save anything, you first must tell it to take the snap shot, 
and then to put the snap shot in the filing cabinet.  You tell git to take snapshots using the add command.  You 
tell git to add the snapshot to the filing cabinet using the commit command.  Using this strategy, the filing 
cabinet is stored on your hard drive, not the cloud.
